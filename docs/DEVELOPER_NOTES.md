### 🐘 What is PostgreSQL?

A relational SQL database that stores all backend data: users, farmers, vendors, inventory, orders, etc.

### 🐳 What is Docker & Why Did We Use It?

Docker creates a **mini isolated environment** where PostgreSQL runs safely without interfering with Windows.  
No installation headaches, no version conflicts, same environment for all developers.

### 🧠 What is SQLAlchemy?

A Python ORM (Object Relational Mapper).  
Lets us write **Python classes** instead of **raw SQL queries**.

### 🔧 What is Alembic & Why Use It?

Alembic is **Git for your database schema**.

- When models change → Alembic creates migration files
- Migration files keep database structure consistent everywhere
- Teams avoid schema conflicts
- Production DBs stay synchronized safely

Without Alembic, databases become mismatched and break the application.

---

# 💻 Commands Used:

### ▶ Start PostgreSQL using Docker

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

### ▶ Check running containers

```sh
docker compose ps
```

### ▶ Stop and reset database volume

```sh
docker compose down -v
```

### ▶ Enter PostgreSQL inside container

```sh
docker exec -it agrichain_db psql -U postgres
```

### ▶ Create database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE agrichain;
```

### ▶ Initialize Alembic

```sh
alembic init alembic
```

### ▶ Create migration file

```sh
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial migration"
```

### ▶ Apply migration

```sh
alembic upgrade head
```

# 📂 Files Modified:

- **docker-compose.yml**
- **.env**
- **alembic.ini**
- **alembic/env.py**
- **.gitignore**
- Initial migration in `alembic/versions/`

---

# 🐞 Issues Faced:

### ❌ Issue 1 – Alembic “database does not exist”

**Cause:**  
Windows had its own PostgreSQL service running on port 5432.  
Alembic connected to that instead of Docker PostgreSQL.

### ❌ Issue 2 – Another process using port 5432 (`wslrelay.exe`)

WSL networking was listening on IPv6 but did not break Docker.  
Needed verification to ensure Docker was still the primary.

### ❌ Issue 3 – Alembic could not autogenerate

`env.py` was missing correct project path + metadata import.

---

# 🛠 How Issues Were Solved:

- Stopped Windows PostgreSQL service

```sh
net stop postgresql-x64-17
```

- Restarted Docker containers
- Recreated database volume
- Updated `env.py` to load Base.metadata correctly
- Re-ran Alembic commands after fixing DB connection
- Verified successful migration creation & application

---

# 📚 Learnings:

- Only **one** process can use port 5432.
- Docker PostgreSQL is safer and isolated from OS conflicts.
- `.env` keeps passwords hidden and secure.
- Alembic is essential for keeping DB changes in sync.
- SQLAlchemy + Alembic is industry-standard for Python projects.
- Docker volumes store data persistently even after container restarts.
- Migrations prevent “works on my PC” database issues.

# ➡️ Next Steps:

- Start **BE-003 – Application Bootstrap**
  - Create `main.py`
  - Add `/health` route
  - Setup router structure
  - Connect DB session with FastAPI

---

📅 Date: 28-11-2025  
🎫 Ticket: BE-003 – FastAPI Application Bootstrap

---

🎯 **Objective**  
Set up the base FastAPI application with a clean folder structure, a configuration module, and a health-check API.  
This forms the foundation for all future modules (Auth, Farmer, Vendor, Orders, Produce).

📝 **Today's Tasks**

🌱 **1. Removed unused folder**

- Deleted old folder `app/routers/`  
  (We use `app/api/routes/` for the modern routing structure.)

⚙️ **2. Added configuration module**  
Created file: `app/core/config.py`  
Purpose:

- Loads `.env` variables
- Centralized project settings (DB, project name)
- Used later in DB connection, JWT config, email config, etc.

📁 **3. Created API routing structure**  
Created:

```
app/api/routes/
```

Purpose:  
This folder will store all API endpoints like `health.py`, `auth.py`, `farmer.py`, `vendor.py`, etc.

❤️ **4. Added Health Route**  
File: `app/api/routes/health.py`

Endpoint added:

```
GET /api/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "version": "1.0" }
```

🚀 **5. Added main FastAPI entrypoint**  
File: `app/main.py`  
Purpose:

- Create FastAPI app
- Include routers
- Define global configuration (title, middleware coming later)

💻 **Commands Used**

```
mkdir app\core
mkdir app\api
mkdir app\api\routes
rmdir /s /q app\routers
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Test API:  
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health`

📂 **Files Modified / Added**

```
app/core/config.py
app/api/routes/health.py
app/main.py
app/api/routes/__init__.py
app/api/__init__.py
```

🐞 **Issues Faced**

❌ **ImportError: No module named app.api.routes.health**  
Cause:

- Missing folders or missing `__init__.py`.

Fix:

- Added correct structure and re-imported.

❌ **Confusion: “Where is health_router function?”**  
Clarification:

- `router = APIRouter()` is imported as:  
  `from health import router as health_router`
- It's an alias, not a function.

📚 **Learnings**

- FastAPI uses `APIRouter()` for modular design.
- `include_router()` mounts routes under a prefix.
- `config.py` centralizes environment variables.
- A clean project layout prevents future complexity.
- Aliasing imports (`router as health_router`) is common practice.
- `main.py` is always the entrypoint for FastAPI.

➡️ **Next Steps**

- Start BE-004 (User Model + Migration)
- Create SQLAlchemy models
- Create Alembic migration for `users` table
- Prepare `schemas` and `services` folder for upcoming Auth module

---

---

📅 Date: 29-11-2025

🎫 Ticket Worked On:

- **BE-004 – User Model & Database Migration**

📝 Today's Tasks:

- Created the first database entity: **User**
- Added SQLAlchemy model file under `app/models/`
- Linked Alembic to SQLAlchemy `Base.metadata`
- Generated migration using Alembic autogenerate
- Applied migration to PostgreSQL inside Docker container
- Verified that `users` table appears in DB

📂 Files Added/Modified:

- `app/models/user.py`
- `app/database/connection.py` (ensured Base is exported)
- `alembic/env.py` (configured target_metadata)
- `alembic/versions/xxxxxxxx_add_users_table.py` (auto migration)

💻 Commands Used:

- `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add users table"`  
  Creates migration file based on model changes.
- `alembic upgrade head`  
  Applies the migration to the actual database.
- `docker exec -it agrichain_db psql -U postgres -c "\dt"`  
  Shows all tables inside the container DB.

🐞 Issues Faced:

- Alembic failing with:
  _“database agrichain does not exist”_
- Hostname `db` not resolving inside Alembic
- Local PostgreSQL Windows service occupying port 5432
- Docker PostgreSQL not getting correct port due to conflict

🛠 How Issues Were Solved:

- Stopped Windows PostgreSQL service (`postgresql-x64-*`)
- Restarted Docker Desktop after freeing port 5432
- Updated Alembic URL to:
  `postgresql://postgres:amogh@localhost:5432/agrichain`
- Ensured database exists by checking with:
  `docker exec -it agrichain_db psql -U postgres -c "\l"`
- Ran revision again after fixing metadata imports

📚 Learnings:

- Alembic needs SQLAlchemy `Base.metadata` to autogenerate tables.
- Local system PostgreSQL can conflict with Docker’s PostgreSQL.
- Docker container hostname (`db`) resolves only inside other containers, **not on Windows host**.
- Best practice: use `localhost` for Alembic when running locally.
- First table migration confirms DB setup, metadata wiring, and pipeline all work correctly.

➡️ Next Steps:

- Create User Pydantic schema
- Build User service layer (create + get user)
- Add `/users` API router
- Prepare BE-005 User Registration API

---

📅 Date: 30-11-2025

🎫 Ticket Worked On:

- BE-005 – User Registration API (Models → Schemas → Service → Router → Testing)

📝 Today's Tasks:

- Added Pydantic schemas for user creation & response
- Implemented password hashing using passlib + bcrypt
- Created UserService for business logic
- Added database session dependency using Depends()
- Implemented POST /users/register endpoint
- Validated duplicate emails
- Wired routes inside main.py
- Tested API on Swagger UI
- Fixed bcrypt installation issue
- Fixed Pydantic schema errors (missing type annotations)
- Ensured DB connection uses correct host (localhost not db)

📂 Files Added/Modified:

- app/schemas/user.py
- app/services/user_service.py
- app/api/routes/user_router.py
- app/database/session.py
- app/main.py

💻 Commands Used:

# Run server

uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Install required packages

pip install passlib[bcrypt]
pip install email-validator

# Check if table exists in DB

docker exec -it agrichain_db psql -U postgres -c "\dt"

# Test API in Swagger

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

# Git workflow

git checkout -b BE-005-user-registration
git add .
git commit -m "BE-005: Implemented User Registration API"
git checkout main
git merge BE-005-user-registration
git push origin main

🐞 Issues Faced:

❌ Issue 1 – Pydantic error:
“created_at has no type annotation”
Reason: Pydantic v2 needs types for all fields.

Fix:
created_at: datetime

❌ Issue 2 – bcrypt backend error:
"module 'bcrypt' has no attribute '**about**'"

Fix:
pip uninstall bcrypt
pip install bcrypt==4.0.1

❌ Issue 3 – Hostname "db" not resolving
Reason: Alembic & FastAPI run on Windows host, not inside Docker.

Fix:
Use:
DB_HOST=localhost

❌ Issue 4 – Password longer than 72 bytes
Reason:
bcrypt has a 72-byte limit.

Fix:
Told user to use shorter password or trim input in frontend.

🛠 How Issues Were Solved:

- Updated DB_HOST to localhost everywhere outside Docker
- Cleaned up schemas to match Pydantic v2 rules
- Installed compatible bcrypt version
- Added proper session dependency for FastAPI
- Wrapped duplicate email error in HTTPException
- Restarted Docker container after DB fixes
- Verified migration exists and table is visible in PostgreSQL

📚 Learnings:

- Pydantic v2 is strict about field type annotations
- bcrypt enforces a maximum password length (72 bytes)
- Alembic uses localhost, not Docker-hostname, when executed on Windows
- Service layer keeps business logic clean and reusable
- Using Depends(SessionLocal) keeps DB session lifecycle correct
- FastAPI's automatic request parsing + validation reduces boilerplate
- Proper folder structure (models, schemas, services, routes) scales better

➡️ Next Steps:

- Start BE-006 – Login & JWT Authentication
- Add token generation service
- Add password verification logic
- Add protected routes (farmer/vendor/admin dashboards)





📅 Date: 30-11-2025
🎫 Ticket: BE-005 – User Authentication (Login + JWT Token Generation)

📝 Tasks Completed:
- Added JWT env variables: JWT_SECRET_KEY, JWT_ALGORITHM, ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES
- Installed packages: python-jose[cryptography], passlib[bcrypt], pydantic-settings
- Updated config.py to include JWT fields
- Created core/security.py → hashing + token creation
- Created services/auth_service.py → login logic
- Added POST /auth/login route in auth_router.py
- Updated main.py to include auth routes

📂 Files Modified/Added:
.env
app/core/config.py
app/core/security.py
app/services/auth_service.py
app/api/routes/auth_router.py
app/main.py

💻 Commands Used:
pip install python-jose[cryptography] passlib[bcrypt] pydantic-settings
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

🐞 Issues & Fixes:
1) BaseSettings import error → installed `pydantic-settings`
2) “Extra inputs not permitted” → added JWT fields to Settings model
3) uvicorn error “main not found” → correct command: uvicorn app.main:app --reload

📚 Learnings:
- JWT tokens need secret key + algorithm + expiry to work
- Pydantic v2 environment management comes from pydantic-settings
- Wrong uvicorn module target breaks server load

➡️ Next Steps:
- BE-006 → Authenticated route `/auth/me`
- Implement token verification & dependency
- Return logged-in user details
